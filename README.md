# Submitting a Solution

In order to submit a solution, you must submit a PR to the appropriate folder with the correct name. 
For example, if the name of today's challenge is sort-list, you would create a new file in:

`daily-algorithm/2016-01-01-sort-list/your-name-sort-list.js`

# Creating a new challenge

```
	npm install
	npm run new-challenge --challengeName=${new-challenge-name}
```

# Why?
Practice with algorithms and data structures, that you don't normally use, helps us look at our everyday problems in a different light.
